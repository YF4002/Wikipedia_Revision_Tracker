Name of The Project: Wikipedia Revision Tracker

Name: Yahaya Fofana and Shristi Khadka

About the Project:
This project is a simple Java-based Wikipedia revision tracker. It takes a Wikipedia article title from the user, fetches the most recent edits from Wikipedia's API, and displays them in the console. It’s designed to handle redirects and errors gracefully, ensuring that even if the user enters an incorrect or misspelled article title, they get a meaningful response.

How It Works:
The program asks the user to enter a Wikipedia article title.
It then fetches the most recent revisions (edits) made to that article.
The data is processed and displayed in a readable format.
If the article doesn’t exist or has been renamed, it should handle redirects properly.


Features: Fetches real-time Wikipedia revision data
Displays edit history with timestamps and editor names
Handles redirects and invalid inputs .Simple, console-based interface

There are two main entry points, you can run it either using GUI or main. To run the GUI, you need to use the GraphicalUserInterface class which is where the GUI is present to interact with the code. Whereas, to run it on console, then you would have to run it in the Main class.
